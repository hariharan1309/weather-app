   - 288K to 293K (15°C to 20°C): Warm
   - Above 293K (20°C): Hot

5. **Grnd_level** (Ground Level Pressure):
   - Below 980 hPa: Low Pressure
   - 980 hPa to 1010 hPa: Normal Pressure
   - Above 1010 hPa: High Pressure

6. **Humidity**:
   - Below 30%: Low Humidity
   - 30% to 60%: Moderate Humidity
   - Above 60%: High Humidity

7. **Pressure** (Atmospheric Pressure):
   - Below 980 hPa: Low Pressure
   - 980 hPa to 1010 hPa: Normal Pressure
   - Above 1010 hPa: High Pressure

8. **Sea_level** (Sea Level Pressure):
   - Similar to Grnd_level and Pressure.

9. **Temp, Temp_max, Temp_min** (Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature):
   - Below 273K (0°C): Very Cold
   - 273K to 278K (0°C to 5°C): Cold
   - 278K to 283K (5°C to 10°C): Cool
   - 283K to 288K (10°C to 15°C): Moderate
   - 288K to 293K (15°C to 20°C): Warm
   - Above 293K (20°C): Hot

10. **Sunrise, Sunset** (Sunrise and Sunset Times):
   - These values represent timestamps and are not categorized in the traditional sense.

11. **Type**:
   - 1: Indicates the weather data is from a weather station.

12. **Weather**:
   - Since weather description is subjective, it's not directly categorized into high, moderate, or low. Instead, it provides a textual description of the weather conditions.

13. **Wind Deg, Gust, Speed** (Wind Direction, Gust Speed, Wind Speed):
   - Below 5 km/h: Calm
   - 5 km/h to 15 km/h: Light Breeze
   - 15 km/h to 30 km/h: Moderate Wind
   - Above 30 km/h: Strong Wind

These categorizations are based on general weather norms and may vary depending on regional climate conditions and user preferences.

Certainly! Categorizing weather parameters can help users quickly understand the conditions and potential impacts. Here's a basic categorization for the weather parameters you mentioned:

1. **Temperature**:
   - Below 0°C: Very Cold
   - 0°C to 10°C: Cold
   - 10°C to 20°C: Cool
   - 20°C to 25°C: Mild
   - 25°C to 30°C: Warm
   - 30°C to 35°C: Hot
   - Above 35°C: Very Hot

2. **Weather Description**:
   - Clear: Clear Skies
   - Clouds: Partially Cloudy
   - Rain: Rainy
   - Thunderstorm: Thunderstorms
   - Snow: Snowy
   - Fog: Foggy

3. **Humidity**:
   - Below 30%: Low Humidity
   - 30% to 60%: Moderate Humidity
   - Above 60%: High Humidity

4. **Wind Speed**:
   - Below 10 km/h: Light Breeze
   - 10 km/h to 30 km/h: Moderate Wind
   - Above 30 km/h: Strong Wind

5. **Atmospheric Pressure**:
   - Below 980 hPa: Low Pressure System (Typically associated with stormy weather)
   - 980 hPa to 1010 hPa: Normal Pressure
   - Above 1010 hPa: High Pressure System (Typically associated with fair weather)

For forecast parameters:

1. **Temperature Highs and Lows**:
   - Highs:
     - Very Cold: Below 0°C
     - Cold: 0°C to 10°C
     - Cool: 10°C to 20°C
     - Mild: 20°C to 25°C
     - Warm: 25°C to 30°C
     - Hot: 30°C to 35°C
     - Very Hot: Above 35°C
   - Lows: Same categories as highs but shifted lower by about 10 degrees Celsius.

2. **Precipitation Chances**:
   - Below 30%: Low Chance of Precipitation
   - 30% to 60%: Moderate Chance of Precipitation
   - Above 60%: High Chance of Precipitation

By categorizing weather parameters in this way, users can quickly understand the conditions and make informed decisions about their activities or travel plans. You can represent these categories using visual cues such as colors, icons, or descriptive labels in your weather app.
